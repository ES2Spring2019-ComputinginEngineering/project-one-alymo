# Micro:bit Pendulum Period Modeling
  These set of programs allow a user to collect position, velocity, and acceleration data using a micro:bit attached to the bob of pendulum to model the motion of pendulums of different lengths. Angular position over time as well as angular acceleration over time will be plotted for each length. The period will also be generated for each length. The length of the pendulum can be graphed by the period on a log-log graph, and a relationship will be observed between length and period of a pendulum. This can be compared to a simulation program, which will simulate the motion of pendulum when given length values and calculate a period. These values can also be graphed on a log-log graph, and the graph of the simulated values can be compared to the real-world data to determine how well the pendulum model's an ideal pendulum.
